## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Heroku for deployment

I REALLY love astrology, and in the future, I plan on expanding on this API, but for now, I decided to create a simple Astrology API that anyone (even myself) can use to be one of the tools for an awesome astrology website. I want to break the barriers and misunderstandings that people have around astrology, and also, there is not enough data for certain pieces of astrology, so this is the starting point for myself. This can be pulled up in a simple JSON object and integrated to the individuals's liking. 

## Optimizations

As I expressed above, this project is definitely going to be expanded upon in the near future. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned through out this build that I can definitely expand on it in the future. I also made the mistake of setting each object name without wrapping it in quotes, then wondering why it didn't work. After some troubleshooting, I realized that this was the cause to the issue that I was facing, so I fixed it and all worked out well.
